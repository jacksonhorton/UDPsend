# UDPsend
UDPsend is a personal project. It's purpose is to send UDP commands over the network at a higher level than a CLI.

To use UDPsend, you need a destination ip address, message, and port.

I have also implemented an optional presets/saves feature which allows you to save all of the settings for a network command and save/load them natively.
